# Balancing-a-Segway
Balancing a Segway using Control theory with MATLAB and SIMULINK

The aim of this project is to make a Segway robot to stand up on itself using control theory. 

First part of this project was to do simulations on SIMULINK and make theoritical assumptions. Second part of the project is to test a PID controller on the Segway and tuning the robot by adding controllers onto the existing PID controller to make the robot stand on itself. Last part of the project was to validate the controller that we used and add an observer to the controller to make it more stable. The aim at the end of the project was to stabilize the robot making it more roboust against real world uncertainties with the plant parameters. 

Technologies used here are MATLAB and SIMULINK.
