# Balancing-a-Segway
Balancing a Segway using Control theory with MATLAB and SIMULINK

The aim of this project is to manipulate a robotic arm to test out mechanical theories of robotics. 

This project is based on the robotics course which included Kinematics, visual servoing, mapping, path planning, Localization and other mobile robotics theories which was put in practice with the projects on the robotic arm. The arm used here was a PUMA robot and its stand alone simulator. 

Technologies used here are PUMA Simulator, C++, Robot Operating System.
