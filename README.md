# PUMA-Robot-Arm-Manipulation
Make different Experiments on the PUMA robot

This project is aimed at manipulating the PUMA robot to make it do some tasks assigned based on Algorithms that are theorised by Linear Algebra and calculus. Different algorithms like machine vision, tracking with the end effector, ROS based SLAM, RRT to track a path defined by us. 

Technologies used here are C++, PUMA simulator, Robot Operating System.
